# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Fourth Project
The goal of this project is to test the student's ability to use webpack along with the previously learnt NodeJS, Express Routing, and web APIs. The outcome is a web app that takes a user text input and evaluates it using natural language processing, giving an output. 

The source code was cloned from the fend-webpack-sass repository provided by Udacity in lesson 4.
